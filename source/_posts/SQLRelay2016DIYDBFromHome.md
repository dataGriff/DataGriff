I am speaking again at SQL Relay this year and I decided to cover some of the basics. It was only about 18 months ago I had never used source control, never used any cloud services and it all seemed quite beyond me... But it's not!
The aim of my talk this year is to hopefully speed up this process for people who find themselves in a similar situation that I was in and show all the free tools and resources that are available to you.

The presentation covers the basics of the following:
* Database design
* Work management
* Source control
* Infrastructure locally and in the cloud
* Database Development
* Deployment

## PreRequisites

The demonstrations in the talk require the following:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [Github Account](https://github.com/) - For source control
* [Team Services Online Account](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) - For source control and Work Management
* [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - For code development and infrastructure
* [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=52679) - For code development and infrastructure
* [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) - For infrastructure
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html), [Atom](https://atom.io/) - These are both useful text editors

## Accompanying Youtube Videos

I've pushed the boat out with this years talk and decided to make myself a youtube channel and playlist to demonstrate the tools used.

## Accompanying Github Repository

I've also created a more detail github code respository of the MyGymDB project which I hope to add to over time.
This includes a ReadMe file with further details and instructions to implement the database yourself.
